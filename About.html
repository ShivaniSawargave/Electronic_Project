                <p class="lead">Electronics is a scientific and engineering discipline that studies and applies the
                    principles of physics to design, create, and operate devices that manipulate electrons and other
                    electrically charged particles. Electronics is a subfield of physics[1][2] and electrical
                    engineering[3] which uses active devices such as transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits to
                    control and amplify the flow of electric current and to convert it from one form to another, such as
                    from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) or from analog signals to digital
                    signals.Electronic devices have hugely influenced the development of many aspects of modern society,
                    such as telecommunications, entertainment, education, health care, industry, and security. The main
                    driving force behind the advancement of electronics is the semiconductor industry, which in response
                    to global demand continually produces ever-more sophisticated electronic devices and circuits. The
                    semiconductor industry is one of the largest and most profitable sectors in the global economy, with
                    annual revenues exceeding $481 billion in 2018. The electronics industry also encompasses other
                    sectors that , which generated over $29 trillion in online sales in 2017.</p>

                <p class="lead">The identification of the electron in 1897 by Sir Joseph John Thomson, along with the
                    subsequent invention of the vacuum tube which could amplify and rectify small electrical signals,
                    inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age. Practical applications started with the
                    invention of the diode by Ambrose Fleming and the triode by Lee De Forest in the early 1900s, which
                    made the detection of small electrical voltages, such as radio signals from a radio antenna,
                    practicable.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Device and Component</h2>
                <p class="lead">An electronic component is any component in an electronic system either active or
                    passive. Components are connected together, usually by being soldered to a printed circuit board
                    (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function. Components may be packaged
                    singly, or in more complex groups as integrated circuits. Passive electronic components are
                    capacitors, inductors, resistors, whilst active components are such as semiconductor devices;
                    transistors and thyristors, which control current flow at electron level.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Design</h2>
                <p class="lead">Electronic systems design deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex
                    electronic devices and systems, such as mobile phones and computers. The subject covers a broad
                    spectrum, from the design and development of an electronic system (new product development) to
                    assuring its proper function, service life and disposal. Electronic systems design is therefore the
                    process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to satisfy specified requirements of
                    the user.</p>

                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Packaging Method</h2>
                <p class="lead">Many different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For
                    instance, early electronics often used point to point wiring with components attached to wooden
                    breadboards to construct circuits. Cordwood construction and wire wrap were other methods used. Most
                    modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as FR4, or the cheaper
                    (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper (SRBP, also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade
                    marks) and FR2) – characterised by its brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated
                    with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products
                    destined to go to European markets.</p>

                <p class="lead">The electronics industry consists of various sectors. The central driving force behind
                    the entire electronics industry is the semiconductor industry sector,which has annual sales of over
                    $481 billion as of 2018. The largest industry sector is e-commerce, which generated over $29
                    trillion in 2017. The most widely manufactured electronic device is the metal-oxide-semiconductor
                    field-effect transistor (MOSFET), with an estimated 13 sextillion MOSFETs having been manufactured
                    between 1960 and 2018. In the 1960s, U.S. manufacturers were unable to compete with Japanese
                    companies such as Sony and Hitachi who could produce high-quality goods at lower prices. By the
                    1980s, however, U.S. manufacturers became the world leaders in semiconductor development and
                    assembly</p>
